        <h1>Putin the Pig</h1>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a powerful leader named Vladimir Putin. One day, as he was walking through the forest, a wicked witch cast a spell on him, turning him into a pig! The piglet Putin was now the laughing stock of the entire animal kingdom.

        <p>
            As he wandered through the forest, he stumbled upon a group of Ukrainian villagers who were busy preparing their traditional dish, Salo. The villagers, not recognizing the rotund pig as their former leader, decided to use him for their meal. As they sliced and diced the pig, they laughed and joked about how delicious their dish would be.

            And so, Putin the pig was cut for Ukrainian Salo meal, and the villagers celebrated their delicious revenge on the once-powerful leader.

            The moral of the story? Be careful who you make fun of, because you never know when you might become the punchline.
